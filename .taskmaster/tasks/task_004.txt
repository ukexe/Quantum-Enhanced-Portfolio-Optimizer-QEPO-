# Task ID: 4
# Title: QUBO encoder
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Encode portfolio optimization problem as QUBO/Ising model
# Details:
Implement qepo.encoder.build_qubo(objective, constraints, penalties). Objective: maximize return - lambda * risk + penalties. Support binary encoding for K assets and adaptive penalty scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Feasibility tests on synthetic problems. Verify QUBO energy aligns with objective trends.
