# Task ID: 5
# Title: QAOA solver (simulator-first)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement quantum approximate optimization algorithm using Qiskit Aer simulators
# Details:
Implement qepo.quantum_qaoa.solve_qubo(qubo, config). Support Qiskit Aer backends (statevector, qasm), SPSA optimizer with restarts, configurable depth p in [1..5] and shots. Log all params/metrics/artifacts to MLflow.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with small synthetic QUBO problems. Verify bitstring candidates returned and MLflow logging.
