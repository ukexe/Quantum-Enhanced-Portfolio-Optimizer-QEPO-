# Task ID: 7
# Title: Classical baselines
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement classical optimization methods for comparison with quantum solver
# Details:
Implement qepo.baselines.mvo_solve() using PyPortfolioOpt/cvxpy with same constraints. Implement qepo.baselines.greedy_k() heuristic. Track runtime and performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify feasible portfolios consistent with constraints. Compare baseline metrics with quantum results.
