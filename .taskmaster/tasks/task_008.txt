# Task ID: 8
# Title: Post-process and repair
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Repair near-feasible quantum solutions to satisfy all constraints
# Details:
Implement qepo.postprocess.repair(bitstring, constraints). Re-normalize weights, enforce caps, round portfolio weights.

# Test Strategy:
All outputs satisfy constraints. Weight sum within epsilon. Test with various infeasible inputs.
